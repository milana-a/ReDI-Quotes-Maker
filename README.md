# ReDI-Quotes-Maker
Demo Day Project
This is a small program (written on Python), that helps ReDI participents to be inspired by a quote according to there status - a student or a theacher. 
I want to join the next ReDI course Front END 1 and create this program as a web page using HTML, CSS and JS
